# xtensa-rpi-script
This is a script for automatically downloading and compiling https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng on the RPI.
If you already have a $HOME/esp directory, you can use the intall_dont_execute.sh script, otherwise just use the install.py installer.
There is also a precompiled version available under https://github.com/Dschorim/xtensa-rpi.git.
